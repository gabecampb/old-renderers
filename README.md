# old stuff

This repo contains a couple of my old, ugly and abandoned C software rendering library projects, which I dug up from my backup drives and decided to open-source in their full hideous glory.

We have br.h, from the lovely:
`Everything, 2019-07-17/Flash Drive, 2018-12-02`

And Rendering Library (rl.h), from the lovely:
`Everything, 2019-07-17/Flash Drive, 2018-12-02/RL, 2018-03-13`

If I recall correctly, br.h is the best of the two libraries. They are both non-usable. There might be newer versions of these libraries, and if I ever find them I'll be sure to update this repo, but I don't count on it as my form of VCS back in 2018 was folders named by the date they were uploaded on and some of the files I uploaded to the flash drive I used to use were corrupted.
